My First Data Analysis Project on the datasets from Maven Analytics.

This is a dataset from Global Electronics Retailer. It contains the sales data from a fictitious
global electronics retailer, including tables containing inforamtion about transcation, products, 
customers, stores and currency exchange rates.

There were 5 datasets and a datadictionary which contained information about all the datasets 
I analyzed the datadictonary and came to a conclusion of first analysis some the primary details
about the data set which includes


1. The customer distribution and the variety of products they sell.
2. Top 5 customers who purchased the more number of products in terms of quantity.
3. Yearly and monthly analysis of the quantity of the products solded.

These are the primary analysis I did on the datasets provided and I came up with conclusion for 3
all the questions.

**1.The customer distribution and the variety of products they sell.**
  The majority of the customers belong to United States and also the customers are distributed 
  among Australia and Europe Region.
  And they sell nearly 33 different item.

**2. Top 5 customers who purchased the more number of products in terms of quantity.**
  The top 5 customers in terms of product quantity are 
  1.Gaspare Trevisan
  2.Paul Warren
  3.Fabrice Lamoureux
  4.Margaret Mattson
  5.Lisa Sherman

**3. Yearly and monthly analysis of the quantity of the products solded.**
  From the yearly and monthly analysis I can clearly see that from 2016 - 2018 there is 
  a good increase in sales. If we can define in percentage it would be
      **2016-2017 -- 15%
      2017-2018 -- 79%**
But after this we could see a drop in sales eventhough the next financial year **2018-2019** eventhough 
they had a good amount of profit of **52%** but there was a slight decrease in sales by **33.5%.**

Then come a year where we all are hit by dealy corona and it hit every nook and corner of all
the buisness and it had the taste of ours too and our sales for **2019 - 2020** drop by **49%**

And by the montly analysis I could understand that the month **December** has a record of high
number of sales most of the year, we could relate this to the regional divisions and come 
to a conclusion that the Chirstmas and NewYear had a effect in the sales

There was good amount of sales from May - October every year and the start of 2020 was good and 
then it drop during the peak of lockdown.

April was performing bad every year if we want to make a note of it.

The intial analysis I did was with quantity the next thing I would be focusing on would be on

1. The top 5 most profitable products,
2. Revenue generated and their trend.


The next analysis I did was with the price and the quantity and I could possibly find that Sales
do slightly decrease when the price goes up. But too when I tried to find the R^2 value in a scatter plot it is almost zero(0.0167), so the the price doesnot have a meaningful impact on the sales. I think the sales might mostly depend on the product category ,marketing trends etc


**The top 5 most Profitable product**

  1. Fabrikam Refrigerator 24.7CuFt X9800 White
  2. Fabrikam Refrigerator 24.7CuFt X9800 Grey
  3. Fabrikam Refrigerator 24.7CuFt X9800 Silver
  4. Litware Refrigerator L1200 Orange
  5. Fabrikam Refrigerator 24.7CuFt X9800 Orange


Next Up I want to find the trend which affects the sales whether it is the category of the product or the seasons.
