**📊 **My First Data Analysis Project – Maven Analytics Sales Data**
🔎 Project Overview**

This project analyzes datasets from Maven Analytics, based on a fictitious global electronics retailer.
The data includes transactions, products, customers, stores, and currency exchange rates, along with a data dictionary.

The aim was to perform an initial exploratory analysis to understand customer distribution, product sales trends, and profitability.

**📂 Datasets**

Transactions – sales records with quantity, price, and currency

Products – details of product categories and names

Customers – customer demographics and regions

Stores – store locations across regions

Exchange Rates – conversion rates for different currencies

Data Dictionary – definitions of all fields

**📑 Key Analyses Performed
1️⃣ Customer Distribution & Product Variety
**
Majority of customers are from the United States, with significant presence in Australia and Europe.

The retailer sells 33 different products across categories.

**2️⃣ Top 5 Customers (by Quantity Purchased)**

**3️⃣ Yearly & Monthly Sales Trends (Quantity Sold)**

2016 → 2017: +15% increase

2017 → 2018: +79% increase (strong growth)

2018 → 2019: –33.5% drop in sales, though profit rose by 52%

2019 → 2020: –49% drop, strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic

**📅 Monthly Insights**

December → consistently highest sales (Christmas & New Year effect).

May–October → steady performance each year.

April → consistently low-performing month.

Early 2020 started strong, but sales dropped sharply during the lockdown.

**💰 Profitability Analysis**

Sales slightly decrease when price increases, but with R² = 0.0167, price does not strongly impact sales.

Other factors like product category, marketing trends, and seasonality likely play a bigger role.
